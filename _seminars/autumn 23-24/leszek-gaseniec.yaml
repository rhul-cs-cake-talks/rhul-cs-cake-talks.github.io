abstract: >
  The model of population protocols provides a universal platform to study distributed processes
  driven by pairwise interactions of anonymous agents. Pairs of agents are drawn by the random
  scheduler uniformly at random from a large population of size n. Each interacting pair is formed of
  the initiator and the responder. On the conclusion of an interaction the states of the two agents
  are modified according to the predefined transition function, i.e., the set of rules underpinning the
  considered process. The state space S of agents is fixed and the size of the population is not known,
  i.e., not hard-coded in the transition function. The sequential time of stabilisation of a population
  protocol refers to the number of interactions required to reach one of the final configurations. More
  recently, the focus is on the parallel time (or simply time) defined as the sequential time divided by
  n, where a given protocol is efficient if it stabilises in parallel time O(poly log n). Finally, we say
  that a population protocol is stable if it stabilises with the correct solution with probability 1.

  Among several computational deficiencies of (also stable) population protocols are: depleting
  fraction of meaningful interactions closing in on the final stabilisation (suppressing parallel efficiency),
  computation power of constant-space population protocols limited to semi-linear predicates in
  Presburger arithmetic (reflecting on the time-space trade offs), and indefinite computation (impacting
  multi-stage protocols). With these deficiencies in mind, we propose a new selective variant of
  population protocols by imposing an elementary structure on the state space, together with a
  conditional choice of the responder during random interacting pair selection.

  We first observe that selective protocols provide a natural mechanism for deterministic emptiness
  test (also known as zero test). It is known that such test enables efficient simulation of O(log n)-
  space Turing Machine with high probability. We first observe that such simulation in selective
  protocols is stable. This means that selective protocols can be used to design efficient solutions to
  problems in O(log n)-space, which are also stable. In particular, we provide fixed-state stable efficient
  solutions to two central problems of leader election and majority computation, with confirmation.
  This is a separation result as stable efficient majority computation requires Ω( log n) states in standard
  population protocols, even if the leader is given. In addition, we study computation of the median
  in a comparison model where the operational state space of agents is fixed and the transition function
  decides on the order between (arbitrarily large) hidden keys associated with the interacting agents.
  We show that computation of the median of n numbers requires Ω(n) parallel time and the problem
  can be solved in O(n log n) parallel time in expectation and whp in standard population protocols.
