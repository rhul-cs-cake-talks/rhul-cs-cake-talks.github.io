  Milind Chabbi is a Senior Staff Researcher in the Programming Systems Team at Uber, USA. He leads initiatives across Uber in the areas of compiler optimizations, high-performance parallel computing, synchronization techniques, and performance analysis tools to make large, complex computing systems reliable and efficient. Milind is also adept at code analysis and automation tools that improve developer velocity. Milind earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Rice University.
abstract: >
  Go is the language of choice at Uber for developing microservices and infrastructure tools. Go brings concurrent programming to the masses. The presence of shared memory alongside message passing makes Go a unique programming language. Writing correct and efficient parallel programs is hard; Go does not guarantee the correctness or efficiency of parallel programs. In this tech talk, I will discuss the landscape of concurrency bugs in Go and how they impact Uber's production software systems. Using data races as an example of shared-memory concurrency bugs and deadlocks as an example of message-passing bugs, I will discuss the tools we have designed and deployed over the past several years to detect and mitigate these bugs at Uber. The insights gained from close inspection of concurrency bugs in Go reveal the complex interplay between language design and concurrency bugs.
