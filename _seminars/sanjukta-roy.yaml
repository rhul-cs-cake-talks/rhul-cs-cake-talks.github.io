bio: >
  Sanjukta Roy is a lecturer in Theoretical Computer Science at University of Leeds. Previously, she was a postdoctoral researcher at TU Wien, Vienna, hosted by Jiehua Chen, CVUT Prague, hosted by Dusan Knop, and Penn State University, hosted by Hadi Hosseini. She received her Ph.D. at IMSc, Chennai, in Jan 2021, where her advisor was Prof. Saket Saurabh. Her thesis is titled ``Select, Allocate, and Manipulate via Multivariate Analysis''. Her areas of specialization are Algorithmic Social Choice, Algorithms, Parameterized Algorithms, and Algorithmic Game Theory. Her research interests include Stable Matching, Fair Allocation, Hedonic games, Voting Theory, and strategic behavior of agents with preferences.
abstract: >
  "Social Choice or Societal Decision Making is concerned with how to aggregate individual opinions or interests. This is the common goal of a wide variety of problems including political elections, evaluation processes for job applicants or products, and recommendation systems in marketing. Two central challenges that must be taken into account from the perspective of a  computer scientist are: (1) How time-efficient is it to find a good decision? (2) Is it possible to manipulate the decision? I will discuss these two questions in the context of voting theory, namely, we will discuss The Committee Selection problem and the Gerrymandering problem. Towards this, we will solve a directed cut problem, a variant of a longest path problem, and use a polynomial method to solve a problem related to graph partitioning."
