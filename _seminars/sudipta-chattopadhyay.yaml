bio:
    Sudipta Chattopadhyay received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the National University of Singapore, in 2013. He is an Assistant Professor with the Information Systems Technology and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore. His general research interests lie in the broad area of cyber security including but not limited to security for AI, Wireless Technologies, and Internet of Things (IoTs). Together with his student, he discovered SweynTooth, BrakTooth and 5Ghoul, families of Bluetooth and 5G NR vulnerabilities that affect billions of devices worldwide. His research has been featured in WIRED, PC Magazine, Hacker News, among others. His discovery has also generated cyber security alerts from government regulatory agencies including CSA (Singapore), DHS, and FDA.

abstract:
    In this talk, I will provide an overview of our past few years' work on Wireless Fuzzing. In particular, I will outline some key challenges that we faced for automatically testing COTS wireless devices over-the-air and how challenges were overcome to develop our security testing technology. I will discuss how our technology had evolved from a generational approach to what we call now man-in-the-middle fuzzing and how such a fuzzing method found more than 70+ security flaws in wireless devices implementing diverse range of protocols e.g., Wi-Fi, BLE, Bluetooth BR/EDR, Zigbee, CoAP and more recently 5G NR.
