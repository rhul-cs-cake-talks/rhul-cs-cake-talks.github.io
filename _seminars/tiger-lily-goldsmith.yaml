bio: >
  Tiger-Lily recently graduated from an MSci in CompSci at RHUL. Now she is a Teaching Fellow and PhD student at RHUL under the supervision of Eduard Eiben and Argyrios Deligkas in the department. Her main interests lie in computational social choice and algorithms and complexity, specifically parametrized complexity.
abstract: >
  In this talk we will see the problem of finding fair allocations -- EF1 and EFX -- of indivisible goods with set-restrictions, which we call orientations. In an orientation every agent gets items from their own predetermined set. For EF1, we show a surprisingly positive result. They always exist! For EFX, we focus on the recently proposed graph instances, where every agent corresponds to a vertex on a graph and their allowed set of items consists of the edges incident to their vertex. However, it was shown that finding an EFX orientation is NP-complete in general. We prove that it remains intractable in some very restricted cases. We essentially match these strong negative results with a fixed parameter algorithm that is virtually the best someone could hope for.
