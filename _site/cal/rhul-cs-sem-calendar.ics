SUMMARY:CS Seminar: Nicola Paoletti -- Causal Temporal Reasoning for Markov Decision Processes
DESCRIPTION:We introduce PCFTL (Probabilistic CounterFactual Temporal Logic), a new probabilistic temporal logic for the verification of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). PCFTL is the first to include operators for causal reasoning, allowing us to express interventional and counterfactual queries. Given a path formula ϕ, an interventional property is concerned with the satisfaction probability of ϕ if we apply a particular change I to the MDP (e.g., switching to a different policy); a counterfactual allows us to compute, given an observed MDP path τ, what the outcome of ϕ would have been had we applied I in the past. For its ability to reason about what-if scenarios involving different configurations of the MDP, our approach represents a departure from existing probabilistic temporal logics that can only reason about a fixed system configuration. From a syntactic viewpoint, we introduce a generalized counterfactual operator that subsumes both interventional and counterfactual probabilities as well as the traditional probabilistic operator found in e.g., PCTL. From a semantics viewpoint, our logic is interpreted over a structural causal model translation of the MDP, which gives us a representation amenable to counterfactual reasoning. We evaluate PCFTL in the context of safe reinforcement learning using a benchmark of grid-world models.

SUMMARY:CS Seminar: Leszek Gasieniec -- Parallel Efficiency and Stability of Selective Population Protocols
DESCRIPTION:The model of population protocols provides a universal platform to study distributed processes driven by pairwise interactions of anonymous agents. Pairs of agents are drawn by the random scheduler uniformly at random from a large population of size n. Each interacting pair is formed of the initiator and the responder. On the conclusion of an interaction the states of the two agents are modified according to the predefined transition function, i.e., the set of rules underpinning the considered process. The state space S of agents is fixed and the size of the population is not known, i.e., not hard-coded in the transition function. The sequential time of stabilisation of a population protocol refers to the number of interactions required to reach one of the final configurations. More recently, the focus is on the parallel time (or simply time) defined as the sequential time divided by n, where a given protocol is efficient if it stabilises in parallel time O(poly log n). Finally, we say that a population protocol is stable if it stabilises with the correct solution with probability 1.
Among several computational deficiencies of (also stable) population protocols are: depleting fraction of meaningful interactions closing in on the final stabilisation (suppressing parallel efficiency), computation power of constant-space population protocols limited to semi-linear predicates in Presburger arithmetic (reflecting on the time-space trade offs), and indefinite computation (impacting multi-stage protocols). With these deficiencies in mind, we propose a new selective variant of population protocols by imposing an elementary structure on the state space, together with a conditional choice of the responder during random interacting pair selection.
We first observe that selective protocols provide a natural mechanism for deterministic emptiness test (also known as zero test). It is known that such test enables efficient simulation of O(log n)- space Turing Machine with high probability. We first observe that such simulation in selective protocols is stable. This means that selective protocols can be used to design efficient solutions to problems in O(log n)-space, which are also stable. In particular, we provide fixed-state stable efficient solutions to two central problems of leader election and majority computation, with confirmation. This is a separation result as stable efficient majority computation requires Ω( log n) states in standard population protocols, even if the leader is given. In addition, we study computation of the median in a comparison model where the operational state space of agents is fixed and the transition function decides on the order between (arbitrarily large) hidden keys associated with the interacting agents. We show that computation of the median of n numbers requires Ω(n) parallel time and the problem can be solved in O(n log n) parallel time in expectation and whp in standard population protocols.
