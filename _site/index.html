        <h4>Short Bio</h4>
        <p>Nicola is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Informatics at King's College London. His interests are in safety and security assurance of cyber-physical (aka autonomous) systems, or CPSs, with an emphasis on biomedical applications. His research aims to develop formal analysis methods (verification, control, and synthesis) to design CPSs that are provably correct. With CPSs increasingly incorporating machine-learning components for e.g., sensing, control and model predictions, his work also focuses on data-driven verification of CPSs, whereby formal analysis and principled learning methods come together to provide correctness guarantees and interpretability, while accounting for the uncertainty and (potential) brittleness introduced by the learning components.</p>
    

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
    
        We introduce PCFTL (Probabilistic CounterFactual Temporal Logic), a new probabilistic temporal logic for the verification of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). PCFTL is the first to include operators for causal reasoning, allowing us to express interventional and counterfactual queries. Given a path formula ϕ, an interventional property is concerned with the satisfaction probability of ϕ if we apply a particular change I to the MDP (e.g., switching to a different policy); a counterfactual allows us to compute, given an observed MDP path τ, what the outcome of ϕ would have been had we applied I in the past. For its ability to reason about what-if scenarios involving different configurations of the MDP, our approach represents a departure from existing probabilistic temporal logics that can only reason about a fixed system configuration. From a syntactic viewpoint, we introduce a generalized counterfactual operator that subsumes both interventional and counterfactual probabilities as well as the traditional probabilistic operator found in e.g., PCTL. From a semantics viewpoint, our logic is interpreted over a structural causal model translation of the MDP, which gives us a representation amenable to counterfactual reasoning. We evaluate PCFTL in the context of safe reinforcement learning using a benchmark of grid-world models.

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
    
        We study the (parameterized) computational complexity of problems in the context of fair allocations of indivisible goods. More specifically, we show fixed-parameter tractability results for a broad set of problems concerned with envy-free, Pareto-efficient allocations of items (with agent-specific utility functions) to agents. In principle, this implies efficient exact algorithms for these in general computationally intractable problems whenever we face instances with few agents and low maximum (absolute) utility values. This holds true also in high-multiplicity settings where we may have high numbers of identical items. On the technical side, our approach provides algorithmic meta-theorems covering a rich set of fair allocation problems in the additive preferences model. To achieve this, our main technical contribution is to make an elaborate use of tools from integer linear programming. More specifically, we exploit results originally going back to a famous theorem of Lenstra [Math. Oper. Res. 1983] concerning (the fixed-parameter tractability of) Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) with bounded dimension (that is, the dimension shall be considered as a (small) parameter) and the more recent framework of (combinatorial) N-fold ILPs. We reveal and exploit a fruitful interaction between these two cornerstones in the theory of integer linear programming, which may be of independent interest in applications going beyond fair allocations. We will also discuss some improvement using the Parametric ILP.

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
    
        The model of population protocols provides a universal platform to study distributed processes driven by pairwise interactions of anonymous agents. Pairs of agents are drawn by the random scheduler uniformly at random from a large population of size n. Each interacting pair is formed of the initiator and the responder. On the conclusion of an interaction the states of the two agents are modified according to the predefined transition function, i.e., the set of rules underpinning the considered process. The state space S of agents is fixed and the size of the population is not known, i.e., not hard-coded in the transition function. The sequential time of stabilisation of a population protocol refers to the number of interactions required to reach one of the final configurations. More recently, the focus is on the parallel time (or simply time) defined as the sequential time divided by n, where a given protocol is efficient if it stabilises in parallel time O(poly log n). Finally, we say that a population protocol is stable if it stabilises with the correct solution with probability 1.
Among several computational deficiencies of (also stable) population protocols are: depleting fraction of meaningful interactions closing in on the final stabilisation (suppressing parallel efficiency), computation power of constant-space population protocols limited to semi-linear predicates in Presburger arithmetic (reflecting on the time-space trade offs), and indefinite computation (impacting multi-stage protocols). With these deficiencies in mind, we propose a new selective variant of population protocols by imposing an elementary structure on the state space, together with a conditional choice of the responder during random interacting pair selection.
We first observe that selective protocols provide a natural mechanism for deterministic emptiness test (also known as zero test). It is known that such test enables efficient simulation of O(log n)- space Turing Machine with high probability. We first observe that such simulation in selective protocols is stable. This means that selective protocols can be used to design efficient solutions to problems in O(log n)-space, which are also stable. In particular, we provide fixed-state stable efficient solutions to two central problems of leader election and majority computation, with confirmation. This is a separation result as stable efficient majority computation requires Ω( log n) states in standard population protocols, even if the leader is given. In addition, we study computation of the median in a comparison model where the operational state space of agents is fixed and the transition function decides on the order between (arbitrarily large) hidden keys associated with the interacting agents. We show that computation of the median of n numbers requires Ω(n) parallel time and the problem can be solved in O(n log n) parallel time in expectation and whp in standard population protocols.

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
    
        Recent years have seen remarkable progress in the capabilities of large deep learning models, especially in language processing. Large language models such as GPT-3 derive a lot of their utility from being zero or few-shot learners, which are instances of a phenomenon labelled in-context learning -- the ability to perform a diverse range of tasks simply based on demonstration examples provided as input context, without any gradient updates to the model parameters. This emergent capability is poorly understood and has intrigued the ML research community. In this talk, I will provide an overview of in-context learning and survey the current state of understanding regarding the emergence of these new abilities in large language models. Then, I will examine the extent to which in-context learning needs large-scale models and the contribution of model architectures versus training approaches. Finally, I will analyse and relate this phenomenon to meta-learning approaches with recurrent architectures that predate large language models.

        The recently introduced technique of flow augmentation has already led to the resolution of several open problems in parameterized complexity. In many cases, flow augmentation can be used through the black box of Boolean constraint satisfaction, a generalization of SAT that provides a common language to encode many prominent problems like Multiway Cut, Multicut, and Directed Feedback Arc Set. Arguably, this common language also provides some intuition for constructing algorithms using flow augmentation. I will introduce the Boolean black box approach and exemplify it with two results, one for undirected and one for directed graphs - namely, Edge Multicut and Directed Subset Feedback Arc Set. The algorithms also work for weighted versions of the problems "out of the box". I will also talk about the project of classifying constraint satisfaction problems parameterized by the number of unsatisfied constraints. No prior knowledge of constraint satisfaction is assumed.

        Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have demonstrated impressive performance on complex tasks such as human-level image understanding and natural language processing. These ML models rely on artificial neural networks that, like biological brains, use billions of neurons and synapses to process complex stimuli. Unlike biological brains, however, these neural networks consume untold amounts of energy, with a single training session often exceeding the energy and carbon footprint of a car over its lifetime. If the current rate of growth continues, ML models could overtake the transportation sector in the global energy balance in 10-20 years, posing another major threat to mitigating climate collapse. In this talk, I will highlight the mechanisms that enable the amazing energy efficiency of biological brains. Based on these findings, I will present new approaches to significantly reduce the energy footprint using hybrid ML/bio-inspired models.

        In this talk, I will provide an overview of our past few years' work on Wireless Fuzzing. In particular, I will outline some key challenges that we faced for automatically testing COTS wireless devices over-the-air and how challenges were overcome to develop our security testing technology. I will discuss how our technology had evolved from a generational approach to what we call now man-in-the-middle fuzzing and how such a fuzzing method found more than 70+ security flaws in wireless devices implementing diverse range of protocols e.g., Wi-Fi, BLE, Bluetooth BR/EDR, Zigbee, CoAP and more recently 5G NR.

        <p>Marcos Matabuena, a Spanish mathematician and current postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, specializes in the development of mathematical models applied to digital medicine. His research focusejs on key areas such as uncertainty quantification, survival analysis, and causal inference, essential aspects for the accurate prediction of clinical events and the optimization of treatments in complex diseases. In the field of diabetes, for example, his models are fundamental for interpreting data from continuous glucose monitors. Additionally, his studies on aging-related decline, through the analysis of physical activity patterns recorded by wearable devices, are of great importance given the aging of modern populations and changing demographic scenarios. One of his most notable contributions is the development of the first mathematical framework for uncertainty quantification in regression models in metric spaces. Marcos has also introduced the innovative concept of 'glucodensity,' an advanced functional representation for interpreting continuous glucose monitoring data and other data collected through wearable devices, surpassing many aspects of traditional clinical biomarkers. Another significant contribution is the development of the first biclustering algorithm in RKHS spaces for complex data analysis

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
    
        Uncertainty quantification is crucial in the era of data-driven systems, providing confidence and accuracy in decision-making, particularly in the field of biomedicine. In this area, clinical decisions often rely on the uncertainty associated with the outcomes of various predictive algorithms. In the context of digital medicine and the evolution of biological measurement systems, clinical data are represented as statistical entities in metric spaces, such as density functions or complex networks, offering a deeper understanding of biological systems. In this presentation, we focus on introducing novel conformal inference algorithms designed for metric spaces, developed by the authors, and demonstrate their application in digital medicine with the high-resolution data mentioned. These novel methods provide robust guarantees, including optimal convergence rates, which are particularly useful when both the predictor and the response are in separable Hilbert spaces. Adaptations of these algorithms to challenges, such as incomplete information (for example, missing data), will also be explored. A significant case study is the development of algorithms for personalized data imputation. By applying this technique and integrating it with digital biomarkers, we have managed to increase the accuracy of predicting the development of diabetes by more than 20%, compared to traditional methods.
