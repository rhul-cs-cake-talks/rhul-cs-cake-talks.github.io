Subject: Call for Departmental Seminars Suggestions (<Term>)

Dear colleagues,
I am now organising next term's seminars.

Just a reminder about the types of speakers we usually invite:
- Departmental seminars: Typically two per term, and usually someone like a professor who will give a good understandable overview talks (e.g. somewhat accessible to the final year undergrads too).
- Technical: Someone visiting or a collaborator who wants to talk about their latest academic paper (i.e. can be more technical).

Although we are back to in person activities, seminars can be given either in person or online, depending on the speaker's needs.

Please let me know if anyone comes to your mind. "Anyone" can also be yourself, if you have some cool results you want to share or want to rehearse a talk.

I am looking to have a programme that is as gender balanced as possible, so suggestions for both male and female speakers are welcome.

Thanks,

    <Organiser>
