Subject: Invitation to give a seminar at Royal Holloway, CS Department

Dear,

My name is <ORGANISER>. I am in charge of organising the departmental
seminar at the Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway University of
London.

I am currently putting together a schedule for this academic term.
<PERSON> here has expressed an interest in hearing you speak.
Would you be available to give a seminar here?

<IF DEPARTMENTAL>
The seminar will be a departmental seminar, aimed at a general audience,
including some of the keener undergraduate students.  As such, an
introductory talk to the area would be desired, rather than a technical
talk aimed at experts.
<ENDIF>

The exact date can be arranged at your convenience.
Seminars normally run on Wednesday 15:00 - 16:00, but this 
can be flexible. Currently the following slots are available:
<LIST OF DATE>

Talks are usually 50 minutes, which makes about 45 minutes of speaking time
with questions.


Many thanks,

<ORGANISER>
