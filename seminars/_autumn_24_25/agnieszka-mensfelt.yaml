abstract: >
  Artificial life is a fascinating research field that draws from biology, chemistry, computer science, and the social sciences to investigate the fundamental principles of life. This presentation will focus on the Framsticks environment â€“ a versatile software that allows users to model, simulate, and optimize artificial life forms. The applications include simulating multi-agent systems, performing evolutionary optimization, and modelling agent control, adaptation, communication, and interaction. The talk will provide an overview of the goals and applications of artificial life, followed by an introduction to Framsticks. It will also discuss selected use cases of the platform.
