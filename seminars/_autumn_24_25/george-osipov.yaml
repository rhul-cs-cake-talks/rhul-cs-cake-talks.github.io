bio: >
  George Osipov is originally from Tbilisi, Georgia, where he did his bachelor’s in computer science and studied towards a master’s degree in mathematics, with an Erasmus year in Uppsala, Sweden. In June 2024 he defended his PhD thesis in theoretical computer science titled “On Infinite-Domain CSPs Parameterized by Solution Cost” at Linköping University, Sweden, under supervision of Peter Jonsson and Victor Lagerkvist. He received a VR international postdoc grant to continue as a postdoc at Linköping University with plans to visit Oxford University for a year in 2025 and Royal Holloway for a year in 2026. He is working mostly on constraint satisfaction and parameterized complexity.

  Based on joint work with Marcin Pilipczuk and Magnus Wahlström to appear at ESA’24.
  The input to the Minimum-Cost Constraint Satisfaction Problem (MinCSP) over the Point Algebra is a set of variables, a collection of constraints of the form x&lt;y, x=y, x≤y or x≠y, and a budget k. The goal is to check whether one can assign rational values to the variables while breaking at most k constraints.
  By restricting the set of allowed constraint types, this problem specializes to several prominent graph problems such as Directed Feedback Arc Set which is MinCSP(<), its subset variant which is MinCSP(<,≤) and Edge Multicut which is MinCSP(=,≠). All three are famously NP-hard but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), i.e. they admit algorithms with running times of the form f(k) poly(n), where f is a function that depends solely on the budget k, while poly(n) is some polynomial in the input size. Another special case is MinCSP(≤, ≠) also known as Directed Symmetric Multicut. Fixed-parameter tractability of the latter was an open problem prior to this work.
  We obtain a complete classification of parameterized complexity of MinCSP(Γ) for all subsets Γ of {<, ≤, ≠, =}. Towards this, we construct an algorithm that solves MinCSP(<,=,≠) - a common generalization of Directed Feedback Arc Set and Edge Multicut. We complement this with a lower bound showing that Directed Symmetric Multicut is W[1]-hard. In the talk I will describe both the ideas behind the algorithm and the lower bound construction. I will also talk about the classification project for Temporal MinCSP - a vast generalization of MinCSP over Point Algebra where all relations first-order definable using < are allowed in the constraints.
