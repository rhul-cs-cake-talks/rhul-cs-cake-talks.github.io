  Dr. Argyrios Deligkas is a Senior Lecturer at the Computer Science Department. His research focuses on economics and computation and more specifically in equilibrium computation, algorithmic game theory, computational social choice, and fair division. He has published over 40 papers in top peer-reviewed conferences in AI, and theoretical computer science, and 16 journals in top peer-reviewed journals. 
abstract: >
  We study the problem of computing approximate market equilibria in Fisher markets with separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC) utility functions. In this setting, the problem was only known to be PPAD-complete for inverse-polynomial approximations. We strengthen this result by showing PPAD-hardness for constant approximations. This means that the problem does not admit a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless PPAD=P. In fact, we prove that computing any approximation better than 1/11 is PPAD-complete. As a direct byproduct of our main result, we get the same inapproximability bound for Arrow-Debreu exchange markets with SPLC utility functions.
  This is joint work with John Fearnley (Liverpool), Alexandros Hollender (Oxford), Themistoklis Melissourgos (Essex).
