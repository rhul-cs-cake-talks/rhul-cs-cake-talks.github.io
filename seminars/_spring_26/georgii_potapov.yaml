abstract: >
  E-variables are a relatively new approach for testing statistical hypotheses that has been experiencing major development during the last several years. E-variables were originally based on a concept of Levin's (average-bounded) randomness tests studied in Algorithmic Information Theory. 

  We introduce the method of e-variable-approximability which can be used to develop a general approximation technique, allowing us to construct e-variables for popular distribution classes important for applications.

  We are going to discuss both this approach and how it helps us to reconnect  theory of e-variables with Algorithmic Information Theory.
